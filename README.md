# DISTRIBUTEUR-DE-BOISSONS
* A simple program of 'un distributeur de boissons" that I have developed during my first year at university using C language.
* I used static tables and divided the work into a group of functions.
* When you open it a menu of the amount of the money you want to enter into the beverage vendor appears and it explains the way you can choose, for example: choosing the number 7 means you are entering 200 DA.
* Choosing 8 means you will not take anything, and the program will be closed automatically.
* After choosing a number between 0 and 7 another menu appears, it's the drinks menu.
* After choosing what you want to buy, the vending machine will make some calculations and tell you if your money is not enough, or give you the drink and the rest of your money if it exists, or tell you if that drink is not available in the machine anymore and return back your money.
